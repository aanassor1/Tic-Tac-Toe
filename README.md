## Description

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C# using Window Forms App (.NET Framework). It provides a classic two-player gaming experience where players take turns to mark their symbols ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The first player to complete a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol wins the game.
